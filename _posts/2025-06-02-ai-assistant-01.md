I’m working on what I call my "super assistant." I don’t have the skills or resources to build a real AI, but with the tools I do have, I’ve made something that I’m actually proud of.

It’s not truly “super,” but compared to doing everything manually, it does enough. Maybe it looks basic to someone working with advanced AI, but for me, it’s a big step.

### Capabilities

- **Calendar:** Can write entries to my Google Calendar. I just say my schedule (“Next week Monday, Tuesday, and Saturday from 14:30 to 00:15”) and it creates those events in bulk.
- **Todo app:** Integrates with Things. I can add or modify tasks by telling it.
- **Cover letter generator:** I input a job ad, it generates a cover letter for me in my own style.
- **Personal finances:** Can access and update my personal finances database.

### Next Steps

- Link different apps together for actual integration (not just separate tasks).
- Handle invoices and manage boring, recurring tasks like bill payments and renewals.
- Smarter reminder options.

## The Goal

I want a general assistant that feels close to AGI—something that just handles all the routine stuff, so I don’t have to.


As a non-software person, seeing what's possible with AI tools just gets me more excited. The "super assistant" may not be AGI-level (yet 😅), but it’s already saving me time and sanity, and that’s a win.
