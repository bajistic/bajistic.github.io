i've been building my own ai assistant on and off for a month now.

right now, like 90% of everything is ai-generated code.  
another 9% is me refactoring or cleaning up that code.  
maybe 1% is handwritten by me.

some stuff is probably faster to just do by hand, but having an ai bang it all out at typing speed is just awesome.

## what it can do

- **gmail:** reads and writes my emails (could be risky if i‚Äôm not careful üôÉ)
- **calendar:** creates google calendar events for me‚Äîi just say stuff like ‚Äúnext week monday, tuesday, and saturday from 14:30 to 00:15‚Äù and it adds them all.
- **todo app:** hooks into things for adding and editing tasks the lazy way (by talking).
- **cover letter generator:** throw it a job ad and it whips up a cover letter in google docs, using my own style, past references, cv, etc.
- **personal finances:** tracks and updates my finances with its own little database.
- **transaction tracking:** i send a receipt photo and it parses out items and the payment total.

## next up

- actually link the apps together for ‚Äúreal‚Äù integration, not just doing tasks separately.
  maybe start with automating something like tax declaration.
- scan my inbox for important mails and actually handle follow-up: schedule invoices, catch errors, handle small admin tasks, ask for clarifications, etc.

## the goal

- deal with invoices and boring, repeating stuff like bills and renewals.
- make reminders smarter (right now they‚Äôre pretty basic).

## the stack

- node server running on a raspberry pi
- connects to openai api
- uses google docs + calendar apis

## privacy notes

- uses telegram api, openai api, so there are obviously privacy risks to consider. but openai probably has all my data so whatever
