Welcome to this example blog post! You’ll find this file in your `_posts` directory. Feel free to tweak it and run `jekyll serve --livereload` to see your changes in real-time—perfect for experimenting with your Minima theme customizations.

Jekyll enforces a specific naming convention for blog posts:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

For this post, that’s `2025-03-08-exploring-jekyll-features.md`. The front matter at the top (between the `---` lines) tells Jekyll how to process the file. Check this post’s source as an example of how it’s structured.

Let’s showcase some Jekyll goodies, like a code snippet styled with Minima’s defaults:

{% highlight python %}
def greet_user(username):
print(f"Hello, {username}!")

greet_user("Alex")
# => Outputs: Hello, Alex!
{% endhighlight %}

Pretty neat, right? The `highlight` tag renders code with syntax highlighting, and since you’re using Minima, it’ll inherit your Inter font if set up correctly.
