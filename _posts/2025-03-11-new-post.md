you know what i decided not to give a _fuck_ and just experiment different things. i get too wrapped up in my head, overthinking, overcomplicating things, when all along I had the choice to do so.

so this is a short post, without proper capitalization, to assure myself that things really arent that serious m8 just do things, and let ur faith decide.

there actually just are no rules in here, no ones reading this, yet (maybe?)

im really not good at long form text.
im also really not good at writing.
not good at thinking, linearly.
not good at yapping,

shit what am i even good at? lol

Anyways, heres a logo i found on ig which i find cool, i believe of art museum aargau.

<img src="/assets/images/logo-ak.jpg" width="350" alt="My Image">

More text here. now piss off, would ya?
